                                        React Native
.....................................................................................

What is React Native?

1.React Native is js lib for building native mobile apps 
2.React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class  JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Mobile App development:

 Mobile apps are built using mobile platforms and os.

Mobile platforms:
1.Android
2.Ios

Mobile devices are acting front end devices, user interfaces communicates back end services.

Dev:
 1.user interface developer/front end developer
 2.back end developer
 3.full stack developer.

Front end developer who dev apps for  front devices.

Dev generally build apps for desktops:
  Standalone desktop apps
  Browser based apps- javascript,html,css - react,angular,vue.....

Mobile /Tab apps:
 Dev builds apps for android platform using java , kotlin pl.
 in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C.

Types of mobile Apps:
.....................

1.Native Mobile
2.Web apps
3.Hybrid apps

1.Native Mobile
   Mobile apps are built by using native platform languages- java / Swift.
2.Web apps
   Apps built for browsers -Mobile browsers
3.Hybrid  apps
   built apps using javascript but it wont run inside browser, runs inside mobile using container(WebView).


Hybrid apps:

 Application built using javascript,css,html,looks like native apps.

Why Hybrid Apps?

-incase native apps, we need to maintain two code base for both platform.

Why not to build one single portable app for all platforms?

 That is birth of hybrid apps.

Hybrids apps can be built using existing web tech- js,css,html.
Js is simple dom language, how to access platform services such as contacts,networks,storage..
- a lib was created -cordova , based on cordova adobe started building a framework on top of the cordova , called phoneGap.

How to build mobile native apps in portable way using same javascript technology without html and css?

......................................................................................................
			   That is birth of React Native.
....................................................................................
React Native Architecture


React native applications are written using react(js) core principles
 -Component
 -Props
 -State
 -Event Handling
 -hooks
 -life cycle events

Every react native apps are simple javascript code.

In React Native, there is no webview concept. React native never run inside browser.

ReactNative code base is classified into two category

1.User Interface
2.Application logic

In Normal react js, User interface is written using HTML language, application logic is written using plain js(react js using state,events,props)...

In React Native, User interface is written using "Mobile Elements", application logic is written using plain js(react js using state,events,props)...


UI Mark Up code for React native:

React native does not use html language to build ui elements.

React Native provides a high level ui components already written, so we can use those
components only.Why?

 We are building portable application either for android or ios.
So we need generic concept for both  platforms. 
For that React native provides a generic components for both platforms.

What is it? What is happening during compilation?

Source code is converted into another source code - Compilation.
Another code is platform specific code. android code or ios code.
if i wirte ui components, ui components will be converted to platform spefic components.
javascript code will be emitted as it is-app code.

How react native apps are executed?  Execution Model:
.....................................................

All views are executed by platform runtimes eg: android by art.
All javascript is executed by Hermes Js engine.

			 How to create React Native Project
..............................................................................................
There are two ways to create React Native Project.

1.Using React native community project

 If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI.
 It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.

Open source, you dont need to use any copyrights.
It offers only limitted features like basic Userinterface components like Button,View,List,Image.
if you want to communicate with native platform services like camera,location,contacts, React Native core team has not provided any apis or compoents.
You have to depend on community only...

YOu can select platform services via react native community web site

-Community -https://reactnative.directory/

2.Using Expo Framework

Expo Work flow:
...............
What is expo?

 Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

..............................................................................................
Project Setup:

.....................................................................................
			ReactNative Project
....................................................................................

You can setup either using React Native cli or EXPO Cli.


React Native cli:
................

Windows-Android:

Requirements:

Node js,
React Native command line interface,
JDK,
Android Studio

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native&os=windows&platform=android

>npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init <ProjectName>

When you create project and building project

1.you should create project in powershell or bash shell with admin rights.


npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init  MyReactNativeApp

√ Downloading template
√ Copying template
√ Processing template
√ Installing dependencies
√ Initializing Git repository


  Run instructions for Android:
    • Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected.
    • cd "G:\IBM\2024\Dec\ReactNative\native\MyReactNativeApp" && npx react-native run-android

  Run instructions for Windows:
    • See https://aka.ms/ReactNativeGuideWindows for the latest up-to-date instructions.

How to run react native project either for android or ios

Way 1
npx react-native run-android 
npx react-native run-ios - if your app is ios app

Way 2
npm run android
npm run ios

Way 3
npm start
ios - i
android - a

...........................................................................................

Any js application can be written using "typescript" as well.

Typescript is programming language which extends the features of js, typescript is super set of js.

What is drawback of js?
 Type system.
js is static typed language, means we cant enforce the type system like java, c,C++

int a =10
a="hello" - compile time error.

let a =10
a="hello" - no compile time error.

What if i want strong typing in js? 
  That is brith of typescript.

Typescript is strongly typed programming language, which was created on the top of core ES 6.

if you want strong strong typing in your js apps,you can write type script code...

typescript cant be executed directly on any js runtime, so we have to compile into plain js.

Hello.ts -->compile--if any compile error-fix it-- Hello.js ---Run

React Native cli project by default is enabled with typescript integration.
  
Component Extension:

App.jsx -  Js based React
App.tsx - Ts based React 


Files:

tsconfig.json
   Typescript compiler configuration

package.json

  "scripts": {
    "android": "react-native run-android",
    "ios": "react-native run-ios",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "start": "react-native start",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "18.3.1",
    "react-native": "0.76.5"
  },

metro.config.js
const {getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig} = require('@react-native/metro-config');

const config = {};

module.exports = mergeConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), config);
...........................................................................................
app.json
 This file is used to supply name of the application and display name which is shown as a lable when we move app to device or emulator

{
  "name": "MyReactNativeApp",
  "displayName": "MyReactNativeApp"
}

babel.config.js
  This is compiler configuration file
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
};
............................................................................................
			 Application Entry File
.............................................................................................

index.js

import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
import App from './App';
import {name as appName} from './app.json';


//JS Entry Point to React Native app
AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);

App.tsx or App.jsx
  Root Component 


Folders:
........
node_modules
   Contains libs and framework code
.bundle 
   contains bundled executable code

React Native Applicaiton is pure react application, so we follow all react features like components,props,state,listeners,hooks etc...

React Native does not support HTML as markup.

React Native is built around built in React Native Elements called components

React Native apps are collection of components(From react native core,third party components,expo components).

Core Components and APIs
........................
Basic Components
User Interface
List Views
Android-specific
iOS-specific
Others

Basic Components:
 Text,View,Image,TextInput,StyleSheet,ScrollView etc...

User Interface Components
 Button,Switch

ListViews:
 FlatList
 SectionList


src/App.jsx
import { Text, View } from "react-native"

function App() {
    return <View>
         <Text>Hello React Native!</Text>
    </View>
}
export default App
.............................................................................................

import { Text, View } from "react-native"

const Profile = props => {
    return <View>
        <Text>Profile</Text>
    </View>
}
export { Profile };

src/App.jsx
import { View } from "react-native"
import { Profile } from "./components/profile/Profile"

function App() {
    return <View>
         <Profile/>
    </View>
}
export default App

props:
......

import { View } from "react-native"
import { Profile } from "./components/profile/Profile"

function App() {

    return <View>
        <Profile data={{ id: 1, name: 'Subramanian Murugan', status:true }} />
    </View>
}
export default App
