What is React Native?

1.React Native is js lib for building native mobile apps 
2.React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class  JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Mobile App development:

 Mobile apps are built using mobile platforms and os.

Mobile platforms:
1.Android
2.Ios

Mobile devices are acting front end devices, user interfaces communicates back end services.

Dev:
 1.user interface developer/front end developer
 2.back end developer
 3.full stack developer.

Front end developer who dev apps for  front devices.

Dev generally build apps for desktops:
  Standalone desktop apps
  Browser based apps- javascript,html,css - react,angular,vue.....

Mobile /Tab apps:
 Dev builds apps for android platform using java , kotlin pl.
 in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C.

Types of mobile Apps:
.....................

1.Native Mobile
2.Web apps
3.Hybrid apps

1.Native Mobile
   Mobile apps are built by using native platform languages- java / Swift.
2.Web apps
   Apps built for browsers -Mobile browsers
3.Hybrid  apps
   built apps using javascript but it wont run inside browser, runs inside mobile using container(WebView).


Hybrid apps:

 Application built using javascript,css,html,looks like native apps.

Why Hybrid Apps?

-incase native apps, we need to maintain two code base for both platform.

Why not to build one single portable app for all platforms?

 That is birth of hybrid apps.

Hybrids apps can be built using existing web tech- js,css,html.
Js is simple dom language, how to access platform services such as contacts,networks,storage..
- a lib was created -cordova , based on cordova adobe started building a framework on top of the cordova , called phoneGap.

How to build mobile native apps in portable way using same javascript technology without html and css?

React native applications are written using react(js) core principles
 -Component
 -Props
 -State
 -Event Handling
 -hooks
 -life cycle events

Every react native apps are simple javascript code.

In React Native, there is no webview concept. React native never run inside browser.

ReactNative code base is classified into two category

1.User Interface
2.Application logic

In Normal react js, User interface is written using HTML language, application logic is written using plain js(react js using state,events,props)...

In React Native, User interface is written using "Mobile Elements", application logic is written using plain js(react js using state,events,props)...


UI Mark Up code for React native:

React native does not use html language to build ui elements.

React Native provides a high level ui components already written, so we can use those
components only.Why?

 We are building portable application either for android or ios.
So we need generic concept for both  platforms. 
For that React native provides a generic components for both platforms.

What is it? What is happening during compilation?

Source code is converted into another source code - Compilation.
Another code is platform specific code. android code or ios code.
if i wirte ui components, ui components will be converted to platform spefic components.
javascript code will be emitted as it is-app code.

How react native apps are executed?  Execution Model:
.....................................................

All views are executed by platform runtimes eg: android by art.
All javascript is executed by Hermes Js engine.
